# React v16 Mini Demo

A simple project with current React version, some design parts optimized for low bandwidth.

It's roughly 125 K currently. This makes it possible to use React on homepage level. I'm using WebPack 4 and almost all dependencies are the very latest stables (March 2018).

## Setup

Clone the repo and do this on a console / terminal:

~~~
npm i 
~~~

Than create the *dist* folder:

~~~
npm run build
~~~

See the *dist* folder with the file send to browser.

Start the http server to serve the files:

~~~
npm start
~~~

## What is it?

A simple mortgage calculator. UI and text portions are German language.
